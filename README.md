# LinearFunctionCalculator
You can enter single coordinate and slope to find y and x intercept. You can also enter two coordinates and get slope and x and y intercepts calculated.
I will possibly add updates in the near future simplifying it.
Very useful if you're not particularly in the mood to do your Algebra 1 homework.
